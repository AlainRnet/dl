dl: minimalist download ticket service
======================================

dl is a minimalist download ticket service with automatic expiration, written
in PHP. It allows you to upload any file to a Web server and generate a unique
download ticket. The ticket is automatically expired according to the specified
rules. dl is usually installed as a "email attachments replacement" due to its
simplicity (though can be used in other ways).

Requirements
============

* PHP 4.3 or higher.
* Web server access for installation and setup.


Installation
============

DL installation
---------------

* Copy the ``htdocs`` directory contained in the archive to a directory of
  choice under your web server.

* Configure the parameters inside ``include/config.php`` as needed. This
  usually means changing the URL and E-Mail of the service.

* Ensure the ``include`` and ``style/include`` directories are *not* directly
  accessible externally. Type ``http://dl.example.com/include/config.php`` and
  verify that you *correctly* get an "Access Denied" error.

  If you use Apache, the provided ``.htaccess`` files should be already
  sufficient; consult your web server documentation otherwise.

* Create a spool directory that will be used by the service to store the files,
  user and ticket information. This directory *should* be outside of the
  document root of your web server. Fix the permissions so that PHP has
  read/write access to it.

  In the provided ``include/config.php`` this is configured as
  ``/var/spool/dl``. If you web server runs as "nobody:nogroup", issue::

    mkdir -p -m770 /var/spool/dl
    chgrp nogroup /var/spool/dl

  to create correctly this directory.


PHP setup
---------

The maximal upload limit is determined by several PHP configuration
parameters. Check your ``php.ini`` for:

* ``file_uploads``: must be "On".
* ``upload_tmp_dir``: ensure enough space is available.
* ``upload_max_filesize``: change as needed.
* ``post_max_size``: must be at least 1M larger than upload_max_filesize.

The upload limit as shown in the submission form is determined automatically
from the ``upload_max_filesize`` parameter. If you are allowed to do so, you
can also set these parameters with "ini_set()" directly inside
``include/config.php`` (so that it only affects dl).

If PHP was built as an Apache module you can also set them through
``.htaccess`` (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php).


Additional setup for old PHP versions (4.3.4 or lower)
------------------------------------------------------

There are several bugs in PHP 4.x which cannot be circumvented
automatically. If you can, upgrade PHP to at least 4.3.5.

If you cannot upgrade, you need to configure the "$dbHandler" parameter in
``include/config.php`` to something available to your PHP installation (try in
order with: "db3", "db2", "dbm") and use the appropriate Berkeley's DB
``db*_load`` utility to create an empty database as shown::

  cd /var/spool/dl
  echo | db4.7_load data.db
  echo | db4.7_load user.db
  chmod 770 *.db
  chgrp nogroup *.db

Depending on your system, you have to use the appropriate ``db*_load`` version.
Under several linux distributions these utilities are part of "db*-util"
package.


Simple DL setup
---------------

Once dl has been installed and PHP is set-up correctly, you have to create
at least one user to be able to log in. User management is handled through the
command line (there is no web-interface yet) by using the bundled
``useradmin.php`` utility.

On the server, execute the following commands *with the same user as your web
server* (by using ``su`` or ``sudo`` if necessary)::

  cd /your-installation-directory/include
  php useradmin.php add "admin" "true" "change me"

where:

* ``admin`` is the user name
* ``true`` (or ``false``) sets the administrator status
* ``change me`` is the password

Repeat as many times as necessary. You should now be able to use the web
service.


Advanced user management
------------------------

dl supports both "normal" users and "administrators". A normal user can only
see and manage tickets created by himself. Administrators can see/manage all
the tickets.

dl can use the HTTP authentication provided by your web server. This should be
the preferred form of authentication for corporate use since it supports
whatever authentication scheme your web server already supports. dl will
consider all users as "normal" by default. The only setup required is flagging
the administrators with ``useradmin.php``.

Users can be managed through ``useradmin.php``, which should be executed with
*the same user as the web server*. Run::

  cd /your-installation-directory/include
  php useradmin.php help

to get a list of all available commands (currently "add", "rm" and
"list"). Passwords are optional since they are ignored when using HTTP
authentication.


HTTP/External authentication
----------------------------

Only ``admin.php`` needs to be password-protected, *not the whole
directory*. With Apache, this can be achieved with the following simple
configuration::

  <Directory /your-installation-directory>
      <Files admin.php>
	 AuthType Basic
	 AuthName "Restricted Area"
	 ...
	 Require valid-user
      </Files>
   </Directory>

To make "Logout" work, you must also set the *same* authentication realm in
both ``AuthName`` and ``include/config.php``. Logout with HTTP authentication
is not guaranteed to work: users should simply **close their browser** to clear
their session (closing a tab or window is not enough). Currently, logout works
as expected on:

* Firefox 3.x
* Safari 4.x
* Google Chrome/Chromium

Logout does not work on:

* Internet Explorer 7/8.
* Opera 9/10.

Only *Basic* authentication is supported, which transmits the password in
clear-text unless you use SSL.


PHP/FastCGI
===========

Apache
------

FastCGI support in Apache up to 2.2.x is severely lacking with all the
available modules: ``mod_fcgi``, ``mod_fcgid`` (now merged officially into
Apache's ``mod_fcgi``) and ``mod_fastcgi``.

* ``mod_fcgi`` and ``mod_fcgid`` buffer the entire request in memory before
  handing-off the request to PHP, meaning that the maximal upload limit is
  bound to your available memory at the time of the request, independently of
  how PHP is setup. This is a known, old bug_ that's still present in both
  ``mod_fcgi`` 2.2.14 and ``mod_fcgid`` 2.3.4. There is no known work-around:
  either use ``mod_php`` or use a different server.

* ``mod_fastcgi`` has been proved to be slow (and sometimes unstable) in most
  configurations. It is not advisable to use PHP with ``mod_fastcgi``.

* For HTTP/External authentication to work, ``mod_rewrite`` needs to be
  enabled, and a different setup is required, as shown::

    <Directory /your-installation-directory>
      <Files admin.php>
	RewriteEngine on
       	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
      	RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "Restricted Area"
	...
	Require valid-user
      </Files>
    </Directory>

Lighttpd
--------

PHP/FastCGI works fine with Lighttpd 1.4.x without any special setup. The
following configuration is required to protect the include directories::

  $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/dl(?:/|/.*/)include/" {
    url.access-deny = ( "" )
  }

You can also enable external authentication with the following::

  auth.require   += ( "/dl/admin.php" => (
      "method"   => "basic",
      "realm"    => "Restricted Area",
      "require"  => "valid-user"
  ) )


Maintenance
===========

Ticket expiration is performed automatically when any web page is
requested. This means that expired downloads will still occupy space on the
spool directory until a web page is first serviced. If you need to ensure that
the spool is purged regularly (for example, for very low traffic servers),
setup a scheduled job that requests the index page. Under UNIX, setup a cron
entry like this::

  0 0 * * * wget -q -O /dev/null "http://dl.example.com/" > /dev/null

In the future, a proper command line script will be provided.


Known limitations/Browser support
=================================

* Tested with Safari 3.x/4.x, Firefox 3.x, Explorer 7/8, Google Chrome/Chromium.
* Tested with PHP 4.x/5.x.
