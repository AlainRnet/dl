Important
---------

* Multiple-file support vs grant re-use (allow more than one grant, grant
  timeout).

  There are several ideas here:

  - Either allow grants to be used multiple times (lame), or
  - Allow uploading multiple files in both ticket and grants, or
  - Allow to upload many files in the tickets/grants form, but generate
    many tickets in the result (which is the easiest to implement right now).

  See [private] discussion with Mokrani for more info.

  Even though generating multiple tickets as a result might be seen as a
  problem, this should result in a single email. Tickets would need to be
  grouped in some way, probably with a new "group" table.

* Save send-link-to addresses into the DB.
  Required for e-mail tracking, and nice to have anyway as a reminder.

* Move alien tickets/grants from the administrator's lists to a separated page.
  My take: definitely important, high priority.

* Do something about passwords through e-mail (either always send the password,
  or never). Important. See:

  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.dl-ticket-service.general/95

  And [private] discussions with Mokrani, Emanuele.

  This will require storing the password of grants in the DB.

* Store the current language when creating a ticket/grant, so that notification
  emails are sent with the same locale. Important/easy. See [private]
  discussion with Mokrani.

* Use file templates instead of hard-coded messages to compose the e-mails.
  See a lot of good suggestions sent by Morkani.

* Move config.php to (or at least reading from) /etc/ on unix platform,
  to simplify update process.

* Hash-based file references, required to implement de-duplication,
  multiple tickets, e-mail tracking. See:

  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.dl-ticket-service.general/140

* Javascript/validation of e-mail address-es.

* Javascript/validation of numerical fields.


Nice to have
------------

* Keep expired ticket IDs into the DB to avoid possible reuse?
  My take: easy to implement, nice to have, but very low priority

* File picking from a directory (patch available)

  My take: nice to have, important for ftp/rsync upload/ticket conversion, but
  low priority.

  In my opinion there should be a better way to generate a ticket from the
  command line. This should enable DL to be integrated with ftp or other file
  services, scripts, and so on. Issues with permissions of the script.

* Support e-mail tracking when using send-link-to.
  Nice to have, but not critical.

* Set sidewide defaults for tickets in config.php.

* Enforce sitewide ticket/grants limits.

* Some sort of quota mechanism to avoid uncontrolled server fill-up.


Suggestions
-----------

* Domain/ip locking of tickets (patch available)
  My take: no strong feeling, low priority.

* Internal IP limit for admin access.
  Easy, but not critical. See:

  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.dl-ticket-service.general/112
